We focus on understanding your specific requirements rather than selling the most expensive options.

### Q: Are your products compatible with existing systems?
**A:** Many of our products are designed to work with existing systems, but compatibility depends on several factors:
- The specific products and systems involved
- Age and specifications of existing equipment
- Communication protocols and standards
- Software versions and firmware
- Physical connection types

We can perform a compatibility assessment to determine which products will integrate with your current setup. When compatibility challenges exist, we offer bridge solutions or alternative recommendations.

- **Specialty Cameras**: Low-light, thermal, and license plate recognition cameras

Our selection includes products from trusted brands like Hikvision, EZVIZ, and other quality manufacturers, with resolutions ranging from 2MP to 8MP (4K).

### Q: What recording options are available for security cameras?
**A:** We offer several recording solutions to meet different requirements:
- **Network Video Recorders (NVRs)**: For IP camera systems, with storage capacities from 1TB to 16TB
- **Hybrid Recorders**: Support both analog and IP cameras for mixed environments
- **Cloud Recording**: Subscription-based storage with no local hardware required
- **Edge Recording**: Camera-based storage using SD cards
- **PC-Based Recording**: Software solutions for computer-based recording

Each option has specific advantages depending on your security needs, budget, and existing infrastructure.

### Q: How much storage do I need for my security cameras?
**A:** Storage requirements depend on several factors:
- Number of cameras in your system
- Recording resolution (higher resolution requires more storage)
- Frame rate settings (higher frame rates increase storage needs)
- Motion-based vs. continuous recording
- Required retention period (how long you need to keep footage)

As a general guideline:
- A single 2MP camera recording continuously at 15fps requires approximately 7-10GB per day
- A 4MP camera needs roughly 15-20GB per day
- An 8MP (4K) camera uses approximately 25-40GB per day

We can provide a detailed storage calculation based on your specific system configuration.

### Q: What's the difference between IP and analog cameras?
**A:** IP (Internet Protocol) and analog cameras differ in several important ways:

**IP Cameras:**
- Connect to networks via Ethernet or Wi-Fi
- Higher resolution (typically 2MP to 8MP)
- Advanced features like video analytics
- More flexible installation options
- Individual camera access from multiple locations
- Better scalability for system growth

**Analog Cameras:**
- Connect directly to recording devices via coaxial cable
- Lower resolution (typically up to 2MP)
- Simpler setup and configuration
- Often more affordable for basic systems
- Reliable operation with minimal complexity
- Typically require dedicated monitoring equipment

We generally recommend IP camera systems for new installations due to their superior features and future-proofing, but we support both technologies.
