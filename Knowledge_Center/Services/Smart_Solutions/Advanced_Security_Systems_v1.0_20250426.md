## Common Questions
[AI-EXAMPLE]

Q: How many cameras do I need for my property?
A: The number of cameras depends on several factors including property size, layout, entry points, and specific security concerns. As a general guideline:
- Small apartment/office: 2-4 cameras covering main entry points and valuable areas
- Medium villa/business: 6-10 cameras providing perimeter and interior coverage
- Large property/enterprise: 10+ cameras with comprehensive coverage

During our security assessment, we analyze your specific property to recommend the optimal camera count and placement for effective coverage without unnecessary redundancy. We use property plans and walkthroughs to identify vulnerability points and ensure appropriate coverage of critical areas.

Q: Can I access my security system when I'm traveling?
A: Yes, remote access is a standard feature of our security systems. You can securely view live and recorded footage from anywhere in the world using our mobile app or web portal. The system uses encrypted connections to ensure your security data remains private. This allows you to:
- Check on your property in real-time
- Review recorded events and footage
- Receive and manage notifications
- Adjust system settings remotely
- Share temporary access with trusted individuals if needed

Our remote access solution is designed to work reliably across various network conditions while maintaining strict security standards.

Q: How long is security footage stored?
A: Storage duration depends on your selected package and specific requirements:
- Essential Package: Typically 14 days of storage
- Professional Package: 30 days standard storage
- Enterprise Solution: Customizable storage (30-90+ days)

Storage capacity is determined by several factors including:
- Number and resolution of cameras
- Recording schedules (continuous vs. motion-activated)
- Frame rate settings
- Scene complexity and compression efficiency

We can customize your storage solution based on your retention requirements, and we offer both local and cloud storage options with automatic management of storage capacity.

Q: What happens during a power outage?
A: Our security systems include several measures to address power interruptions:
- Core recording equipment is connected to uninterruptible power supplies (UPS)
- The system automatically resumes normal operation when power is restored
- All configuration settings are securely stored and not affected by power loss
- Critical events prior to power loss are preserved in storage
- Battery backup options are available for cameras in critical locations

For clients with mission-critical security requirements, we can implement extended backup power solutions or generator integration to maintain full functionality during prolonged outages.

Q: How secure is the system from hacking?
A: We implement multiple layers of cybersecurity protection:
- Network segregation to isolate security systems
- Enterprise-grade encryption for all data transmission
- Secure authentication with multi-factor options for remote access
- Regular security updates and patches
- Intrusion detection mechanisms
- Custom firewall rules to protect the system
- Security hardening of all devices and software

Our implementations follow security best practices established by leading industry organizations, and we regularly review our security measures against emerging threats. While no connected system can guarantee absolute security, our approach minimizes vulnerabilities while maintaining functionality.

Q: Can the security system integrate with my other smart home or building systems?
A: Yes, our security systems are designed with integration in mind:
- Seamless connection with home/office automation platforms
- Integration with access control and intercom systems
- Coordination with lighting for enhanced security
