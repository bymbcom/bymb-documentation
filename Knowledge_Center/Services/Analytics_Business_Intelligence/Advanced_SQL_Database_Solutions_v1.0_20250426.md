## FAQ for Internal Team

### Q: How do we approach clients with minimal database expertise?
A: We emphasize education along with implementation. Our process includes more detailed explanations, simplified technical documentation, and additional knowledge transfer sessions. We focus on relating database improvements to business outcomes rather than technical details.

### Q: What options do we offer for clients concerned about system downtime during database changes?
A: We implement several strategies to minimize downtime, including staged implementations, parallel systems during migration, off-hours deployment, and rolling updates when possible. We develop detailed cutover plans with fallback options to mitigate risks.

### Q: How do we handle situations where the client's hardware is insufficient for their database needs?
A: We provide clear hardware recommendations with performance projections. We can also recommend cloud options with cost-benefit analysis or implement interim optimization strategies that work within current hardware constraints while planning for future upgrades.

### Q: What is our approach when clients have both on-premises and cloud database needs?
A: We design hybrid solutions that leverage the strengths of both environments. This might include maintaining transactional systems on-premises while implementing analytics in the cloud, or using cloud services for development and testing while keeping production on-premises.

### Q: How do we ensure clients can maintain complicated database solutions after implementation?
A: Knowledge transfer is integral to our approach. We provide comprehensive documentation, conduct hands-on training for database administrators and developers, create maintenance guides and procedures, and offer ongoing support packages. We also build solutions with maintainability in mind, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
