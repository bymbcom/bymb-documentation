## FAQ for Internal Team

### Q: How do we handle clients who have never used Power BI before?
A: We provide a more comprehensive onboarding process, including Power BI fundamentals training, guided dashboard walkthroughs, and more frequent check-ins during the first few months. We also develop simpler initial dashboards that can be enhanced over time as users become more comfortable.

### Q: What options do we offer for clients who want on-premises data to remain on-premises?
A: We offer Power BI Report Server implementations for clients with strict data residency requirements. Alternatively, we can implement secure gateway configurations to maintain data on-premises while leveraging cloud-based Power BI features.

### Q: How do we address clients concerned about Power BI licensing costs?
A: We conduct a thorough needs assessment to recommend the most cost-effective licensing approach. This might include a mix of Pro and Premium Per User licenses, or in some cases, Premium Capacity for larger organizations. We also help identify opportunities to leverage existing Microsoft 365 E5 licenses.

### Q: What is our approach when clients have data quality issues?
A: We incorporate data quality assessment in our discovery phase and provide recommendations for improvement. We implement appropriate data cleansing steps in Power Query and can develop data quality dashboards to help clients monitor and address ongoing quality concerns.

### Q: How do we ensure clients can maintain their Power BI solution after implementation?
A: Knowledge transfer is integral to our approach. We provide comprehensive documentation, conduct hands-on training for report creators and administrators, and offer ongoing support packages. We also build solutions with maintainability in mind, using best practices for naming conventions, folder structures, and documentation.
