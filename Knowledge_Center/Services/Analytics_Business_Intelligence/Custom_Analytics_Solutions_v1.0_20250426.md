## FAQ for Internal Team

### Q: How long does a typical Custom Analytics Solution take to implement?
A: Implementation timeframes range from 4-10 weeks depending on complexity, with the discovery phase typically taking 1-2 weeks, development 2-4 weeks, and testing/deployment 1-2 weeks.

### Q: How do we handle clients with poor data quality?
A: We incorporate a data quality assessment in the discovery phase and provide recommendations for improvement. When necessary, we can include data cleansing as part of the implementation plan, though this may extend timelines.

### Q: What is our approach when clients have mixed technology environments?
A: We design solutions that can integrate with various technologies. Power BI can connect to numerous data sources, and we can implement custom connectors when standard ones aren't available. We prioritize creating a seamless experience regardless of the underlying technologies.

### Q: How do we ensure clients can maintain the solution after implementation?
A: Knowledge transfer is a core component of our delivery process. We provide comprehensive training, detailed documentation, and optional ongoing support packages. We also build solutions with maintainability in mind, avoiding overcomplicated designs.

### Q: How do we position our Custom Analytics Solutions against competitors?
A: We differentiate by emphasizing our business-first approach rather than technology-first, our experience across multiple industries, our focus on practical insights rather than complex systems, and our comprehensive support and training program.
