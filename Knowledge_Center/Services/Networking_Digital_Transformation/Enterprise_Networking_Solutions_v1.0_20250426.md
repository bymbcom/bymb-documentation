## FAQ for Internal Team

### Q: How do we approach clients with limited technical knowledge?
A: We focus on business outcomes rather than technical specifications in our communications. We explain concepts in simple terms, relate technology to business benefits, use visual aids to illustrate network concepts, and provide documentation tailored to different audience technical levels.

### Q: What is our approach when clients have budget constraints but significant needs?
A: We develop phased implementation plans that address critical issues first, recommend quality cost-effective solutions where appropriate, explore managed services options to reduce capital expenditure, and prioritize investments based on business impact and risk reduction.

### Q: How do we handle sites with challenging physical infrastructure?
A: We conduct thorough site surveys to identify limitations early, recommend appropriate technologies for difficult environments (like mesh networks for buildings with limited cabling options), work closely with facilities teams, and develop creative solutions that respect physical constraints while meeting technical requirements.

### Q: What is our strategy for clients with specialized compliance requirements?
A: We maintain up-to-date knowledge of major regulatory frameworks, incorporate compliance requirements into design from the beginning, document how solutions address specific compliance points, and can bring in specialized compliance consultants for highly regulated industries when necessary.

### Q: How do we support clients after implementation is complete?
A: We offer tiered support packages to match their needs, provide comprehensive documentation and knowledge transfer, establish clear escalation procedures, schedule regular review sessions, and offer proactive monitoring options to address issues before they impact operations.
