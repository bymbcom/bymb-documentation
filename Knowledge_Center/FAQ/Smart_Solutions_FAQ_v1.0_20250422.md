- Voice commands can control security features
- Single app control for both security and home automation

This integration provides both enhanced security and greater convenience.

### Q: How do voice assistants work with smart home systems?
**A:** Voice assistants like Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri can control your smart home through verbal commands. After integration, you can:
- Control lighting ("Turn on the living room lights")
- Adjust temperature ("Set the thermostat to 22 degrees")
- Manage entertainment ("Play music in the kitchen")
- Check security ("Show me the front door camera")
- Activate scenes ("Good morning" to trigger a morning routine)
- Ask for information ("What's the temperature in the bedroom?")

We can integrate multiple voice assistants based on your preference and ensure they work seamlessly with your smart home system.

### Q: Can you create custom automations for specific needs?
**A:** Yes, creating custom automations tailored to your specific lifestyle is one of our specialties. Examples include:
