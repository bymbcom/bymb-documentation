## Service Overview
[AI-PRIORITY]

The Emergency Response Procedure outlines BY MB Consultancy's systematic approach to handling critical incidents that may impact service delivery, client systems, or company operations. This procedure ensures rapid, coordinated responses to emergencies, minimizing potential damage and restoring normal operations as quickly as possible.

**Key Benefits:**
- Minimizes downtime and service disruption
- Protects client data and systems
- Provides clear guidance during high-stress situations
- Ensures business continuity
- Maintains client trust through transparent incident management

**Target Audience:**
- Internal technical teams
- Support staff
- Management
- Client liaisons

## Service Features

### Incident Classification System
- **Critical (Level 1)**: Complete service outage or severe security breach affecting multiple clients
- **Major (Level 2)**: Significant service degradation or security incident affecting a single client
- **Moderate (Level 3)**: Partial service disruption with workarounds available
- **Minor (Level 4)**: Issues with minimal operational impact that can be scheduled for resolution

### Response Team Structure
- **Emergency Response Coordinator (ERC)**: Oversees the entire emergency response operation
- **Technical Response Team**: Handles the technical aspects of incident resolution
- **Client Communication Lead**: Manages all client communications during the incident
- **Executive Liaison**: Keeps management informed and secures necessary resources

### Communication Protocols
- Structured notification system based on incident severity
- Predefined communication templates for different incident types
- Regular status updates at predetermined intervals
- Multi-channel communication strategies (email, phone, SMS)

### Business Continuity Provisions
- Disaster recovery procedures for critical systems
- Backup resources and redundancy planning
- Alternative service delivery methods during extended outages

## Implementation Process
[AI-EXAMPLE]

### 1. Incident Detection and Reporting
The emergency response process begins when an incident is detected through:
- Automated monitoring alerts
- Client reports of service disruption
- Staff observation of abnormal system behavior
- Security breach notifications

Any staff member who identifies a potential emergency should immediately report it to the support line at +973-66300033 (press 0) or email emergency@by-mb.com with subject "EMERGENCY: [Brief description]".

### 2. Initial Assessment and Classification
Upon receiving an emergency report, the on-duty support specialist will:
- Gather preliminary information about the incident
- Classify the incident severity using the Incident Classification System
- Initiate appropriate notifications based on severity
- Create an incident record in the tracking system

Example: If a client reports complete loss of access to their security camera system during business hours, this would typically be classified as a Level 2 (Major) incident.

### 3. Response Team Activation
Based on the incident classification:
- Level 1 (Critical): Full Emergency Response Team activation
- Level 2 (Major): Technical Response Team and Client Communication Lead
- Level 3 (Moderate): Technical specialist and notification to supervisor
- Level 4 (Minor): Assignment to appropriate support staff

The Emergency Response Coordinator (ERC) is automatically assigned for Level 1 and 2 incidents.

### 4. Containment and Mitigation
The Technical Response Team works to:
- Contain the incident to prevent further impact
- Implement immediate mitigation measures
- Establish workarounds where possible
- Document all actions taken

### 5. Client Communication
The Client Communication Lead ensures:
- Initial notification to affected clients within 15 minutes of incident classification
- Regular updates at predetermined intervals (30 minutes for Critical incidents, hourly for Major incidents)
- Clear explanation of the impact, actions being taken, and estimated resolution time
- Final notification when the incident is resolved

### 6. Resolution and Recovery
Once the immediate issue is addressed:
- Verify the effectiveness of the solution
- Restore normal operations
- Document the resolution
- Conduct initial impact assessment

### 7. Post-Incident Review
Within 48 hours of incident resolution:
- Conduct a detailed analysis of the incident
- Identify root causes and contributing factors
- Document lessons learned
- Develop recommendations to prevent recurrence
- Update emergency procedures as needed

## Technical Requirements
[AI-CAUTION]

### Hardware Requirements
- Emergency response team members must have access to:
  - Mobile devices with minimum 4G connectivity
  - Laptop with VPN capabilities
  - Backup power sources (power banks, UPS)
  - Alternate communication devices if primary systems fail

### Software Requirements
- Incident management system access
- Remote system administration tools
- Monitoring dashboards
- Secure communication platforms
- Documentation access (online and offline capabilities)

### Network Requirements
- VPN access to client systems
- Backup internet connection methods
- Access to cloud-based recovery systems
- Secure remote access tools with proper authentication

### Security Requirements
- All emergency communications must be encrypted
- Authentication required for all system access during incident response
- Activity logging and audit trail for all actions taken
- Compliance with data protection regulations even during emergencies

## Common Questions
[AI-EXAMPLE]

Q: What qualifies as an emergency requiring this procedure?
A: An emergency is any situation that causes or threatens significant disruption to client services, risks to data security, or impacts business operations beyond normal troubleshooting scenarios. This includes complete system outages, security breaches, data loss incidents, and any situation where multiple clients are affected simultaneously.

Q: Who has authority to declare an emergency?
A: Any team member who identifies a potential emergency can initiate the procedure, but official classification is done by the on-duty support specialist or any manager. For Level 1 (Critical) emergencies, the final declaration requires approval from a department head or executive.

Q: How quickly should clients be notified of an emergency?
A: Initial client notification should occur within 15 minutes of incident classification for Level 1 and 2 emergencies. For Level 3, notification should occur within 30 minutes, and for Level 4, within business hours the same day.

Q: What information should be included in client communications during an emergency?
A: Client communications should include: nature of the incident, known impact, actions being taken, estimated resolution time (if available), workarounds if applicable, and when the next update will be provided. Communications should be factual, clear, and avoid technical jargon.

Q: How is the emergency response procedure tested?
A: BY MB Consultancy conducts quarterly emergency response drills using simulated incidents. These drills test both technical response capabilities and communication procedures. All staff are required to participate in at least one drill annually.

## Escalation Criteria
[AI-ESCALATE]

### Technical Escalation
Emergency incidents should be escalated to higher technical authority when:
- The incident cannot be contained within 30 minutes
- The impact is spreading to additional systems or clients
- Specialized expertise is required beyond the initial response team
- The incident involves potential data breach or regulatory compliance issues

Technical escalation path:
1. On-duty Support Specialist
2. Technical Team Lead
3. IT Director
4. Chief Technology Officer

### Management Escalation
Management escalation is required when:
- The incident is classified as Level 1 (Critical)
- The incident involves potential reputational damage
- The incident may result in significant financial impact
- The incident duration exceeds predetermined thresholds:
  - Level 2: > 2 hours
  - Level 3: > 4 hours
  - Level 4: > 8 hours
