## FAQ for Internal Team

### Q: How do we approach integration when clients have a mix of cloud and on-premises systems?
A: We implement hybrid integration architectures that bridge cloud and on-premises environments. This typically involves deploying integration components in both environments with secure connectivity between them. We might use an iPaaS solution for cloud-to-cloud integration while implementing on-premises connectors for legacy systems, with API gateways managing traffic between environments. Security is paramount, so we implement strong authentication, encryption, and network controls for all cross-environment communications.

### Q: What strategies do we use when integrating with legacy systems that lack modern APIs?
A: We employ several approaches based on the legacy system's capabilities. For systems with database access, we might implement database-level integration with change data capture. For systems with file export capabilities, we create file-based integrations with automated processing. When screen interactions are the only option, we can implement RPA solutions. In some cases, we develop custom adapters that wrap legacy interfaces in modern API layers, creating a bridge between old and new technologies.

### Q: How do we ensure data consistency across integrated systems, especially with bidirectional synchronization?
A: Data consistency in bidirectional scenarios requires careful planning. We implement master data management principles to establish authoritative sources for each data type, create conflict resolution rules for simultaneous updates, use timestamps and version tracking to manage changes, implement transaction management to maintain integrity, and develop reconciliation processes to detect and resolve inconsistencies. We also establish clear data governance policies and monitoring to maintain consistency over time.

### Q: What is our approach to security in integration projects, especially when dealing with sensitive data?
A: Security is layered throughout our integration implementations. We implement strict authentication for all integration points, encrypt data both in transit and at rest, apply data masking for sensitive information, implement least-privilege access controls, create detailed audit logging of all transactions, and conduct regular security testing. For clients in regulated industries, we incorporate compliance requirements into the architecture from the beginning and document how our implementations meet specific regulatory standards.

### Q: How do we minimize business disruption during major integration projects?
A: We employ several strategies to reduce business impact. We implement changes in phases rather than all at once, conduct integration cutover during low-activity periods, develop parallel running capabilities where possible, create comprehensive rollback plans for each deployment, implement thorough testing before production changes, and provide enhanced support during transition periods. We also work closely with business stakeholders to communicate changes, prepare users, and develop contingency plans for critical business processes.
