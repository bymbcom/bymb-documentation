## FAQ for Internal Team

### Q: How do we identify which processes to prioritize for automation?
A: We use a multi-factor evaluation framework that considers process volume, frequency, complexity, error rates, business impact, and automation feasibility. We typically recommend starting with high-volume, rule-based processes that are currently causing bottlenecks or have significant error rates. We analyze ROI potential by calculating time savings, error reduction, and business impact to prioritize processes that will deliver the greatest value quickest.

### Q: How do we handle processes that can't be fully automated?
A: Many processes require a hybrid approach. We design solutions that automate what can be automated while creating efficient interfaces for necessary human intervention. We focus on eliminating repetitive tasks, automating data collection and routing, and creating clear handoffs when human judgment is required. This approach often delivers 70-80% of the benefits of full automation while accommodating processes that need human oversight or decision-making.

### Q: What's our approach when clients have limited technical resources to maintain automation?
A: We design solutions with maintainability in mind, focusing on low-code platforms where possible and providing comprehensive documentation. We offer training programs tailored to the client's technical capabilities and provide managed service options where we handle ongoing maintenance and enhancements. For clients with minimal technical resources, we emphasize cloud-based solutions with limited infrastructure requirements and simplified management interfaces.

### Q: How do we address concerns about job displacement through automation?
A: We emphasize that process automation typically allows staff to focus on higher-value work rather than eliminating positions. We work with clients to identify how freed capacity can be redirected to activities that improve customer experience, innovation, or business development. We also help develop transition plans that include reskilling opportunities for affected staff, ensuring automation is seen as an enhancement rather than a threat.

### Q: What is our approach when processes span multiple departments or systems?
A: Cross-functional processes often offer the greatest automation benefits but require careful planning. We facilitate collaborative workshops with all stakeholders to document the end-to-end process and identify handoffs and dependencies. We design solutions that bridge departmental silos, implement appropriate notifications and visibility, and establish clear accountability for different process components. We also help establish governance structures for ongoing management of cross-functional automations.
