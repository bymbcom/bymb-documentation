# System Architecture - AI Agent System Infrastructure Overview

## Policy Overview
[AI-PRIORITY]
This document outlines the key infrastructure components required to support the BY MB Consultancy AI Agent System. It describes the technical architecture needed for AI agents to access the Knowledge Center, manage conversation memory, interact with business tools (such as Odoo and the MCP server), and operate effectively to manage business processes and provide customer support.

## Scope
[AI-PRIORITY]
This policy applies to all technical infrastructure layers and components that are essential for the deployment, operation, and maintenance of the AI Agent System. This includes data storage, processing environments, communication interfaces, and integration points with external systems.

## Key Infrastructure Components

The AI Agent System infrastructure is built upon several interconnected components:

### 1. Knowledge Base Storage & Access Layer
[AI-PRIORITY]
This layer is responsible for storing the structured and AI-optimized documentation from the Knowledge Center and providing efficient, secure access to the AI agents for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).

*   **Purpose:** To serve as the central, single source of truth for all business knowledge accessible to AI agents.
*   **Key Technologies:**
    *   **Primary Storage:** GitHub repository (`bymbcom/bymb-documentation`) for version control and source files (Markdown).
    *   **Vector Database:** A specialized database to store document "chunks" and their numerical representations ("vectors" or "embeddings") for fast similarity search.
        *   *Recommended Tools:* Chroma, Qdrant, or PostgreSQL with pgvector extension (potentially via a managed service like Supabase).
    *   **Secure Access Service:** A layer or service that reads from the primary storage/vector database and enforces access control levels (Level 1, 2, 3) based on document metadata before providing content to agents.
*   **Related Documents:** `/Knowledge_Center/README.md`, `/Knowledge_Center/Policies/Knowledge_Center_Policy_for_AI.md`, `/Knowledge_Center/Policies/Data_Privacy_Policy.md`

### 2. Conversation Memory Storage
[AI-PRIORITY]
This component stores the history of interactions for each conversation the AI agents have, enabling context-aware and personalized responses.

*   **Purpose:** To maintain the state and history of ongoing conversations for individual users or sessions.
*   **Key Technologies:**
    *   **Standard Database:** A reliable database capable of storing ordered lists of messages linked to conversation identifiers.
        *   *Recommended Tools:* PostgreSQL, MySQL, or a key-value store like Redis (often for short-term memory).
*   **Related Documents:** `/Knowledge_Center/Policies/Data_Privacy_Policy.md` [AI-CAUTION] (Requires careful handling of chat data)

### 3. AI Agent Execution Environment
[AI-PRIORITY]
This is the computing environment where the code for the individual AI agents (SupportBot, TechBot, SalesBot, AnalyticsBot) runs.

*   **Purpose:** To provide the necessary processing power, memory, and networking for AI agents to operate.
*   **Key Technologies:**
    *   **Computing Resources:** Servers (physical or virtual), Cloud VMs (AWS EC2, Azure VMs, GCP Compute Engine), Container Orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes).
    *   **Programming Language:** Python (as established).
    *   **Libraries/Frameworks:** RAG Frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex), Libraries for interacting with databases (Chroma client, psycopg2, etc.), Libraries for using Language Models (OpenAI API, Hugging Face Transformers, etc.).
*   **Analogy:** The robot's desk and power source.

### 4. Input Channels (Listeners)
[AI-PRIORITY]
The interfaces through which external requests, questions, or data enter the AI Agent System.

*   **Purpose:** To receive communication from users or other systems.
*   **Examples:** Website chat interface, Email listener, API endpoints, Internal messaging platform integration (Slack, Teams).
*   **Infrastructure needed:** Secure network endpoints, listeners configured for specific protocols (HTTP, SMTP, etc.).

### 5. Orchestration & Routing Layer (Manager Robot)
[AI-PRIORITY]
This component receives incoming requests from Input Channels and directs them to the appropriate AI agent or workflow based on the request's nature.

*   **Purpose:** To act as the central traffic controller and initial request handler.
*   **Key Logic:** Analyzing input to determine domain (e.g., Sales, Technical, Support), identifying the correct agent, potentially handling initial basic responses or validations.
*   **Infrastructure needed:** A service or code module running in the execution environment, potentially using simple classification models or rule-based logic.

### 6. Action & Tool Integration Layer (Hands / Tools)
[AI-PRIORITY]
Provides AI agents with the ability to interact with external business systems to perform tasks.

*   **Purpose:** To enable agents to perform actions like creating records, retrieving specific data, or triggering processes in other applications.
*   **Key Integrations:**
    *   **Odoo Integration:** Connection to Odoo's API (XML-RPC, API keys) to interact with CRM, Sales, Inventory, etc.
    *   **MCP Server Integration:** Connection to the MCP server API for managing smart home/security devices.
    *   **Other Tools:** Email sending, Calendar updates, etc.
*   **Infrastructure needed:** Secure API keys and credentials management, libraries for interacting with specific system APIs, potentially a dedicated microservice for handling complex external calls. [AI-CAUTION] (Requires strict security measures).
*   **Related Documents:** [Placeholder for Odoo/MCP API documentation if available]

### 7. Output Channels (Speakers)
[AI-PRIORITY]
The interfaces through which AI agents send responses, actions, or information back to the user or other systems.

*   **Purpose:** To deliver the AI's output effectively.
*   **Examples:** Sending text responses through the chat interface, Replying to emails, Sending API responses, Posting messages in internal chat, Updating records in Odoo.
*   **Infrastructure needed:** Secure network endpoints, connections to messaging/email services, APIs to update external systems.

### 8. Workflow & Human Handoff System (Supervisor Desk)
[AI-ESCALATE]
Ensures that complex requests, sensitive issues, or situations requiring human judgment are correctly identified and routed to the appropriate human team members.

*   **Purpose:** To implement the escalation protocols and approval workflows defined in the Knowledge Center policies.
*   **Key Logic:** Monitoring agent confidence levels, identifying requests with `[AI-CAUTION]` or `[AI-ESCALATE]` markers, triggering alerts, assigning tasks to human queues or individuals, tracking handoff status.
*   **Infrastructure needed:** A workflow engine or code module, integration with task management systems (like GitHub Issues, a dedicated CRM/helpdesk system), notification services (email, internal chat alerts).
*   **Related Documents:** `/Knowledge_Center/Policies/AI_Escalation_Process.md`, `/Knowledge_Center/Approval_Workflow/Approval_Workflow_v1.0_[YYYYMMDD].md`

### 9. Monitoring & Logging System (Supervisor's Cameras & Notebook)
[AI-PRIORITY]
Provides visibility into the AI system's performance, activity, errors, and usage.

*   **Purpose:** To track system health, identify issues, monitor agent performance metrics, and gather data for continuous improvement.
*   **Key Technologies:** Logging frameworks, centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk, cloud logging services), monitoring tools (for CPU, memory, network usage), dashboarding tools (like your KC Status Dashboard, Grafana, Kibana).
*   **Infrastructure needed:** Log collection agents, centralized log storage, metrics collection agents, monitoring server, dashboarding platform.

## Component Interactions (How the Pieces Work Together)

[AI-EXAMPLE]
Requests arrive via **Input Channels**. The **Orchestration Layer** identifies the request type and routes it to a specific AI Agent running in the **Execution Environment**. The AI Agent uses its **Main Brain** (Language Model). If it needs information from the Knowledge Base (Rulebook), it queries the **Knowledge Base Storage & Access Layer** (via RAG). If it needs to remember past conversation details (Relationship), it queries the **Conversation Memory Storage**. Based on the input, knowledge, and memory, the agent may decide to use the **Action & Tool Integration Layer** to perform a task in Odoo or MCP. If the request is complex or sensitive, it triggers the **Workflow & Human Handoff System**. The final response or action is sent back through the **Output Channels**. All these activities are recorded by the **Monitoring & Logging System**.

## Key Considerations

### Security
[AI-CAUTION]
*   Implement robust authentication and authorization for all component interactions.
*   Secure APIs and access credentials for external systems (Odoo, MCP).
*   Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest (especially in Conversation Memory).
*   Regular security audits of the infrastructure and code.
*   Follow Data Privacy Policy guidelines diligently.

### Scalability
[AI-PRIORITY]
*   Design components to handle increased load as the business grows and AI usage increases.
*   Utilize scalable databases (Vector Database, Memory Database) and computing environments.
*   Consider microservices architecture for different components to scale independently.

### Maintainability
*   Use clear coding standards and documentation for each component.
*   Implement automated testing for components and integrations.
*   Plan for regular updates and patching of software and libraries.
