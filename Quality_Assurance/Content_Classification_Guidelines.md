## Classification Workflow

### **Step 1: Initial Classification**
Content creator performs self-assessment and assigns preliminary classification:
- **PUBLIC** - Safe for external distribution
- **CONFIDENTIAL** - Internal use only
- **MIXED** - Contains both public and confidential elements
- **UNSURE** - Requires review for classification

### **Step 2: QA Review**
Quality Assurance Agent validates classification:
- Reviews content against classification guidelines
- Identifies any misclassified information
- Provides specific recommendations for content modification
- Escalates unclear cases to human reviewers

### **Step 3: Content Separation (if MIXED)**
For mixed content documents:
- Create public version with sensitive information removed
- Maintain confidential version for internal use
- Clearly label both versions
- Cross-reference between versions

### **Step 4: Approval and Publication**
- Public content approved for website and external use
- Confidential content restricted to internal knowledge base
- Mixed content published with appropriate access controls
- All versions tracked in version control system
